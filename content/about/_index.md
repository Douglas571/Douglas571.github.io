Hello, my name is Douglas Socorro, I'm a Frontend developer from Latino America.

My main areas of interest are: Web App development with React, Animations, SVG and CSS Layout.

I'm entusiast of Software Development World in General, so apart from Frontend, I like to automate the bored task and lear about compilers and algorithsm. I like to write about what I'm learning and take part of code challege.
